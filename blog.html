                        <strong>Local Storage and Session Storage</strong> are almost the same. Both have the following rules:
                        1. They store key/value pairs for a particular domain.
                        2. The values stored may only be strings.
                        3. They have a limit of around 5MB of storage space.<br>

                        <strong>The one major difference between Local Storage and Session Storage is the expiration date.</strong> <br>

<strong>local Storage</strong> persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration. <br>

<strong>Session Storage</strong> is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new storage.

<strong>Global Scope : </strong> Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.
Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.In client-side JavaScript, the global scope is generally the web page inside which all the code is being executed. <br>

<strong>Block Scope : 
</strong>Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const. These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block. Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.

                       <strong>The event loop : </strong> JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java. <br>
                       The event loop is the secret behind JavaScriptâ€™s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded operation.

                       <strong> Undefined </strong> is a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it. So you can say that undefined means lack of value or unknown value.
                       <br>Example: undefined
                       var myVar;
                       alert(myVar); // undefined <br> 1. In the above example, we have not assigned any value to a variable named 'myVar'. A variable 'myVar' lacks a value. So it is undefined. <br> 2. You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object. 
                       <br> 3. If you pass less arguments in function call then, that parameter will have undefined value. <br> 4. An undefined evaluates to false when used in conditional expression. <br> 5. undefined is one of the main reasons to produce a runtime error in the JavaScript application. This happens if you don't check the value of unknown return variables before using it. If you are not sure that a variable will always have some value, the best practice is to check the value of variables for undefined before using them.
